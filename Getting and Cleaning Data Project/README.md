# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the code and files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

## Dataset

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

    *CodeBook.md*: Code book describing the dataset, the variables and modifications made to the data to transform it to a tidy data set.

    *run_analysis.R*: This script does the following tasks as outlined in the course project requirements:

    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    *TidyData.txt*: The final, tidy data set that is exported to a text file.
